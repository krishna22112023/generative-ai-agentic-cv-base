AutoRestore: Automated, Agentic Image Restoration Workflow
=========================================================

It serves as an authoritative reference for the **AutoRestore** agent – a fully
autonomous, end-to-end image–restoration pipeline that combines quality
assessment, planning, execution, and verification in a closed feedback loop.
The architecture is depicted in the accompanying schematic and is summarised
here for future developers and researchers.

Overview
--------
AutoRestore ingests an arbitrary *image dataset* and produces a corresponding
set of *restored images* with minimal human intervention.  The agent operates
in three high-level phases and relies on two learned models (`DepictQA` and
`Q-Align`) plus a large foundation model for language conditioned image processing (`Qwen-Image-
Edit`).  All processing is parallelised where possible to maximise throughput.

  1. **Assessment & Batching**
     • Each image is scored by the *Image Quality Assessor* (DepictQA), which
       detects multiple degradation types (Noise, JPEG compression,
       Defocus blur, Motion blur, Rain drop, Haze, Low-light) *and* estimates a
       severity level (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High).
     • Images are partitioned into *batches* according to
       *(degradation-type, severity)*.  This guarantees homogeneous error
       characteristics inside a batch so that a single restoration recipe can
       be reused.
     • From every batch one *representative image* is sampled at random.  These
       samples act as surrogates during the expensive planning search that
       follows.

  2. **Planning (Parallel Exhaustive Search)**
     • For each sampled image the agent enumerates candidate *processing
       pipelines* built from the atomic operations provided by
       ``Owen-Image-Edit`` (e.g. `Denoise`, `JPEG Decompression`, `Defocus
       Deblur`, `Motion Deblur`, `Derain`, `Derain Drop`, `Dehaze`, `Enhance
       Low-Light`).  The search is *exhaustive* but distributed across
       ``num_workers = K`` processes to keep wall-clock time reasonable.
     • After a pipeline is executed the result is evaluated by the *Quality
       Scorer* (Q-Align).  Higher scores indicate better perceptual quality and
       fidelity to the non-degraded domain.
     • The procedure is repeated *N* times where *N* equals the number of
       distinct degradations detected in the current batch.  The highest-
       scoring pipeline(s) are retained as *optimal pipelines* for that batch.

  3. **Execution & Verification**
     • The selected optimal pipeline is broadcast to *all remaining images* in
       the originating batch and executed in parallel (again using ``K``
       workers).
     • The processed results are passed through DepictQA once more, now acting
       as an *Image Quality Verifier*. Images are compared to original raw images 
       and those that fail the comparison get better are flagged as *failed images*.
     • Failed cases may be resubmitted to the planner with relaxed search
       parameters or handed off to a human reviewer, implementing a feedback
       loop that continuously improves coverage.

                       └────────── retry failed images ◄────────┘
```

Key Components
--------------
* **DepictQA**: CNN-based quality–assessment model that outputs a vector of
  degradation probabilities and severities.  Used twice: once for initial
  assessment and once for verification.
* **Q-Align**: Learned perceptual metric that correlates strongly with human
  judgement.  Guides the search by turning image quality into a scalar reward.
* **Qwen-Image-Edit**: Collection of differentiable image-processing blocks –
  each parameterised by severity.  Blocks are composable in sequence to build a
  restoration pipeline.

Parallelism Notes
-----------------
All compute-heavy stages (batch assessment, candidate search, batch execution)
are designed for embarrassingly parallel execution.  The implementation should
rely on standard Python concurrency primitives (e.g. ``concurrent.futures``) or
cluster orchestration (e.g. Ray, Dask) depending on the deployment context.

Extending AutoRestore
---------------------
Adding new degradation types involves three steps:
 1. Extend DepictQA’s classifier head to recognise the new category.
 2. Implement a matching editing primitive in Qwen-Image-Edit.
 3. Register the primitive in the planner’s search space.
